Automated deploying iOS builds to TestFlight (http://testflightapp.com).

Script written in bash. Feel free to send me your propositions and improvements.
Will be useful to launch right after your VCS commit or push.

How to use
----------
1. First edit config.sh file and enter your API tokens and stuff.
2. Then create a symbolic link (ln -s source dest) for testflightappdeploy.sh script in your project directory (where is *.xcodeproj file located). Also add this link rights for execution (chmod +x file).
3. Don't forget to put your *.mobileprovision file to the script directory.
4. That's all, run ./link.sh from your project directory.
